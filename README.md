# Redroid ‚Äì Android Application Pentesting Automation Toolkit for Android Studio and Genymotion

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**  
> Redroid is under active development. Some features may be unstable or not fully compatible across environments. Contributions and issue reports are welcome.

**Redroid** is a modular toolkit designed to streamline Android application penetration testing. It automates common tasks such as:

- Installing and configuring Burp certificates and frida
- Managing proxy settings
- Integrating with tools like **Frida**, **Drozer**, **MobSF**, **Nuclei**, **ApkLeaks**, and **TruffleHog**
- Generate and sign exploits (e.g., **Tapjacking**, **Task Hijacking**)
- and much more...

Its interactive CLI interface allows operators to focus on analysis and exploitation instead of setup and configuration overhead.
